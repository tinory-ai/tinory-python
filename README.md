# Tinory

This is an currently an open source project to prove the potential of binary machine learning.

TODO:
- [ ] re-implement all code snippets from Wolfram blog
- [ ] implement training and inference classes
- [ ] train MNIST

Discrete binary machine learning ideas are from this writing by Stephen Wolfram: https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2024/08/whats-really-going-on-in-machine-learning-some-minimal-models/

Framework is built from a fork of tinygrad: https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad

We have no website, email address, or fax machine. All queries can be handled on X: @tinory_ai
